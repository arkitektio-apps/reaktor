# Reaktor

Reaktor is a distribtued scheduler for the Arkitekt Framework. It
is a standalone PluginApp that can be installed.
While every App in the Arkitekt Ecoystem can schedule workflows,
this app does not provide any additional nodes and therefore will
always call other apps in a distributed setting.
